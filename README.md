Explore Space is a web application that allows users to delve into the wonders of space. It provides a visually rich and informative experience for users to learn about celestial bodies, space missions, and astronomical phenomena. This README provides an overview of the application's features, architecture, and setup instructions.

## Features

- **Celestial Bodies**: Browse and explore information about planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects in our universe.
- **Space Missions**: Discover details about past, ongoing, and future space missions, including their objectives, spacecraft, and launch dates.
- **Astronomical Phenomena**: Learn about captivating astronomical events such as meteor showers, eclipses, and comets.
- **Search and Filtering**: Easily search for specific celestial bodies, missions, or phenomena using intuitive search and filtering options.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Experience stunning visual representations of celestial bodies, spacecraft, and astronomical phenomena through captivating images and interactive visualizations.
- **User Profiles**: Users can create profiles, save their favorite discoveries, and track their progress in exploring space.

## Architecture

The application is built using the following technologies:

- **Backend**: The backend is developed using C# and the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides the API endpoints and interacts with the Azure Cosmos DB database.
- **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB is used as the database service, offering a globally distributed, multi-model database for scalable and high-performance data storage.
- **Frontend**: The frontend is developed using Next.js with TypeScript (TSX) language. It leverages React.js for building interactive user interfaces and provides an immersive user experience.

## Prerequisites
